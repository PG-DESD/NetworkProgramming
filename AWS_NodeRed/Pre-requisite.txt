What's the Difference Between Roles and Policies in AWS?
The difference between IAM roles and policies in AWS is that
a role is a type of IAM identity that can be authenticated and 
authorized to utilize an AWS resource, 
whereas a policy defines the permissions of the IAM identity.

1. Create IOT All Access Policy in AWS
AWS_Console->IAM->AccessManagement->Policies->Create Policy

Resources: All resources

2. Create IoT Core Access Policies
AWS_Console->Iot_Core->Security->Policies->Create Policy
Policy name: <name>
Policy effect:Allow
Policy action:*

3. Create IoT Core Access Certificate
